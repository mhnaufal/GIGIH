    # In this case, we are specifying that
    # when given all incorrect letters as guess_word,
    # match_word will return "\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}"

      # The following spec structure is known as given-when-then

      # Given we have a game object with secret_word 'DRINK'
      # and guess_word is 'HELLO'
      game = Game.new('DRINK')
      guess_word = 'HELLO'

      # When we try to match the guess_word with secret word using match_word method

    ### SECOND CASE
    # One additional spec for new scenario: wrongly positioned letter
    it 'should handle a wrongly positioned letter well' do
      # Given a game object with secret_word 'DRINK'
      # and guess_word 'CLEAN' (N is a correct letter but in wrong position)
      game = Game.new('DRINK')
      guess_word = 'CLEAN'

      # When we try to match the guess word
      result = game.match_word(guess_word)

      # Then it should return "\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E6}\u{1F7E8}"
      # which is the ASCII code for ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¨

      guess_word = 'ALIVE'

      result = game.match_word(guess_word)
